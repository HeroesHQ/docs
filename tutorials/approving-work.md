# üëç Approving work

When the bounty is made, there is two options for approval (excluding the whitelist functions):

Manual Approval and Auto-approval

Auto approval only requires a Hunter to express interest and claim a bounty, and then for the Funder to approve it. The bounty will then be completed, and the funds will be sent to the Hunter. This type of approval is best suited for small and fast tasks, that don't require much communication between Hunter and Funder

Manual approval requires one more step from each side. Here the Hunter applies by showing interest, and are then approved to start work. When the work is done the Hunter submits the work, and can then be approved by the Funder for payout. This extra step allows for a more detailed process along the way, so both Hunter and Funder can agree on end requirements before the Hunter invests time, and so that the Funder can concentrate on one Hunter at a time.

Whitelist feature is available for both types of approval, which give the Funder to choose which wallets can apply. In this way the Funder can make a bounty exclusive to a certain community, or even just to make payments to a single person. With this feature the Funder can get rid of a lot of noise that may occur if the Funder already have certain Hunters in mind.
