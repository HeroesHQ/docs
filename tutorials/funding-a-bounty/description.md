Tags are the most important for hunters to be able to find your work. If you need a tag which isn't in the list then you can add it like `#tag` in the body of your bounty request & request for it to be added later.&#x20;

Type of "Other" and Experience of "Any" are fine unless you see a type that describes your bounty better than the tags.
