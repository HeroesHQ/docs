You made it this far which is totally advanced! Multitasking and Application Restrictions are worth digging into. Before that let's review the lifecycle of a bounty on HEROES. Funder actions above the dots, hunter actions under the dots. By default, once delegation happens other hunters are blocked from starting any work (like if an RFP has been rewarded).&#x20;

## Multitasking <a href="#multitasking" id="multitasking"></a>

**Contest/Hackathon** applies to the delegate step. It allows multiple hunters to begin work at the same time, even if there will be only one of them which is paid out in the end.&#x20;

**One For All** is for tasks you want multiple hunters to claim and submit, with each of the hunters earning the same amount when their work is verified.&#x20;

**Different Tasks** splits a bounty up so that multiple team members can work together towards the same goal. Each subtask can earn a different amount when the work is verified.&#x20;

## Application Restrictions <a href="#application-restrictions" id="application-restrictions"></a>

**Manual Approval** is the default. No hunters can begin work until you approve a claim proposal.&#x20;

**Whitelist** allows you to specify wallets that are allowed to propose claims. For example, you could snapshot NFT holders and only allow them to make claims.&#x20;

**Whitelist Auto** allows anyone in your list to begin and submit work without you manually approving their claim proposal. This is useful if a hackathon bounty is being rewarded to a specific team after judging has occured. Another use case is efficiently delegating to trusted teammates.&#x20;

**Auto Approval** skips the claim and delegate steps entirely, allowing a free for all of work to be submitted for verification. If you're running a One For All bounty this can cut your clicks in half.
