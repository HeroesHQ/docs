When it comes to successful delegation, accurately describing the work and expectations are the absolute number one key for success.Boot up your favorite LLM and start bouncing things off it to generate a comprehensive description of the work. Markdown is allowable so you can make headers for the Background, Objectives, Deliverables, Criteria, and Worker Requirements. GPT/Claude/Bard can probably write a snappy title for you too! Here's an example prompt to get you started:

> I need to write up a bounty so I can delegate a task to a gig worker. It's important for the request to be really clear and easy for an international audience to read and understand. If you can help with that give me a üëç and I'll describe the work.

**Acceptance criteria** is a sentence describing the point of handoff. For example, link to published work, GitHub repo, gDrive link with sharing enabled, etc.Provide a full URL to your telegram, twitter, etc to make it easy on the hunters trying to contact you outside of the messaging built into HEROES.
