When a hunter has completed and submitted their work you'll get another notification to verify that it meets your requirements.&#x20;

Inside the bounty it will be marked as completed to indicate your approving the work rather than a claim. The chat will include any final details from the hunter for your review.&#x20;

After your approval funds will be released from escrow to the hunter, mission accomplished!
