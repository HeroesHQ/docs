When creating a bounty the Funder have the option to only allow KYC passed Hunter to apply. This helps prevent bots applying, and for the bounty not to get spammed by trolls with multiple accounts:

We recommed every Individual or Company to go through a KYC/KYB process before starting to use Heroes. To start you KYC/KYB process head up to the top right corner of the site and access the KYC field:

From here you have the option to do either a KYC or KYB verification though Fractal ID. Read more about Fractal ID [`here`](https://web.fractal.id/about-fractal-id/).

After you have followed the steps by Fractal, you will shortly be approved if done correctly, and as a Hunter you are good to go!
