# ðŸ‘®â™‚ KYC/KYB

1. One profile per wallet: Having multiple wallets connected to a single profile is not supported and may lead to issues.&#x20;
2. Enter your legal Last Name and First Name in the Full Name field, which must match your KYC legal documents. If you represent a company, select the 'Company Profile' and choose 'KYB' on the KYC page. Add VAT when required by law (apply reverse charge if applicable). Enter your legal residential address carefully.&#x20;
3. It will not be displayed publicly but it will be displayed on the final invoice. Recommended wallets include wallet.near.org and mynearwallet. Start the KYC process after connecting your wallet (not before).&#x20;
4. When claiming a bounty, ensure you select sufficient time to complete the claim; we recommend using a minimum of one week.&#x20;
5. Make sure you have at least 1.1NEAR on the wallet to be able to claim the bounty. Complete your profile fully so it can be cross referenced in case of any issues with KYC.\

   When creating a bounty the Funder have the option to only allow KYC passed Hunter to apply. This helps prevent bots applying, and for the bounty not to get spammed by trolls with multiple accounts:

We recommed every Individual or Company to go through a KYC/KYB process before starting to use Heroes. To start you KYC/KYB process head up to the top right corner of the site and access the KYC field:

From here you have the option to do either a KYC or KYB verification though Fractal ID. Read more about Fractal ID [`here`](https://web.fractal.id/about-fractal-id/).

After you have followed the steps by Fractal, you will shortly be approved if done correctly, and as a Hunter you are good to go!
