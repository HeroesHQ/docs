# ðŸš¢ Release Notes

We organize work in bi-weekly sprints which you can track via [Open Heroes Milestones](https://github.com/HeroesHQ/HEROES/milestones).&#x20;

Released work is cataloged in [Closed Heroes Milestones](https://github.com/HeroesHQ/HEROES/milestones?state=closed) or via [Closed Heroes Issues](https://github.com/HeroesHQ/HEROES/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). It's also possible to filter closed issues by [bug](https://github.com/HeroesHQ/HEROES/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug+) or [enhancement](https://github.com/HeroesHQ/HEROES/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22WORK+REQUEST%22+) labels.
